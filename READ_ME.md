# Hotkeys

These are the hotkeys that I have/had on my windows machines. Some are fun little scripts that let me quickly modify text for jokes with friends or to spam them with alerts in games. Some are more serious ones that I use to speed up things I've had to do too many times.

### Default Windows Hotkey Creation
- Create a shortcut to the script.
- In the shortcut's properties, set a shortcut key.
- The shortcut key will run the script.
